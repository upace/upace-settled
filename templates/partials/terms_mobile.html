    how that entity will handle your information.</p><br/>

<p>The Application may use third party authorized service providers to provide us with analytical data about
    your use of the Application. We may deploy devices, such as cookies, that enable those third parties to
    anonymously collect and aggregate usage data and report it back to us. Third parties that we engage to
    provide analytics services and to assist in providing the Application’s tools and services cannot use
